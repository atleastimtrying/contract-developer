    <h2>Starting out as a Contractor/Freelancer? or looking to hire someone to do some work on your website?</h2>
    <p>This site is intended to provide an overview of the processes for both parties to make it easier for everyone to build successful working relationships and get some great work done together.</p>

      <h2><a name="employers">What do I look for in a Contractor/ Freelancer?</a></h2>
      <p>One of the main problems that an employer can find in recruiting any specialist is in how to find the right person for the job, and being able to know that they are capable of doing that job efficiently.</p>
      <p>Firstly, you must consider what resources you have within your own team; Do you have any developers who have relevant knowledge? Would you be happy to include them in the interview process? Do you have any external trusted resources you can rely upon?</p>
      <p>Taking some time to think about the specific projects you would be taking this developer on for will help you to establish the skill sets you are looking for. For example: A single page site based around a single workflow requires very different organisational and coding skills to that of a large e-commerce site with multiple products and types of user.</p>
      <p>Try to build a good understanding of the potential developer’s past. It should become clear how they work as part of a team, what their areas of interest are and their expertise in specific areas.</p>
      <p></p>

      <h2>How can I recruit effectively?</h2>
      <p>Finding developers is quite a challenge in the current climate, there are a few things to bear in mind when talking to the calibur of developer you want to employ.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Be tentative about using a recruiter, a poorly chosen one can be expensive and can give the wrong impression to developers.</li>
        <li>You aren&rsquo;t the developer&rsquo;s only potential work</li>
        <li>Making your project requirements clear saves both of you time and therefore money</li>
      </ol>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>How do I know they can do what I need?</h2>
      <p>Be clear on what your project involves, clearly outlining what the goals of your projects are – do you wish to set up an online shop? If so, how many products will you have? How many customers do you predict having? The more information you're able to provide, the better. If you're thinking of creating something new, try to think of other specific examples of similar projects that you may be competiting with to get a good idea of your competition.</p>
      <p>Think carefully about what are the most important aspects of your project; If it could only have feature what would that feature be? This will enable you to think about the scale of your project from the beginning and make it very clear to your developer what your priorites are. Try to visualise what level of involvement you want your developer to have. Are they simply someone doing some work? Are they a partner in your business with personal investment in the project or somewhere in between?</p>
      <p>Basic people skills will help in establishing how genuine your developer is; They should be able to speak confidently about the problem you are providing and avoid overwhelming you with technical jargon. If you have a technical team member or associate it may be worth including them in discussions about the project so they get and idea of the developer on a more technical level. It should soon become clear the competency of the developer.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>How do I know what is a fair price?</h2>
      <p>First and foremost you must consider the value of your website for your business. Is your website going to be your business? Is it an online shop? Is it going to be a promotional tool? What's your main source of revenue? It's worth bearing in mind that if the majority of your revenue is coming from your website, you should consider one of your most significtant investments to be your developer.</p>
      <p>Be clear of the skill level of the developer. This is closely tied to what your requirements are for the site. The majority of junior to medium level developers should be able to give you a simple website providing information and limited e-commerce functionality.</p>
      <p>Interview multiple developers if possible work to work out what is an average price for the work you require. Find other entrepreneurs in similar positions, find out what rates they paid and what their experiences are. Be aware that you tend to get what you pay for and that what you get may not alway be what you want.</p>

      <h2>Where are all the developers?</h2>
      <p>Like any other career-minded people, those who are passionate (and that you would want on your project) tend to enjoy their work and will have many personal projects on the go. These can often be found on <a href="http://www.github.com">Github</a>.</p>
      <p>A passionate developer and a savvy contractor will be keen to network with other developers and expand their list of contacts and potential clients. Regular meet-ups can provide opportunities for both of these activities. Developer meet-ups like <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Norwich-Ruby-User-Group-NRUG/">NRUG</a>, <a href="http://iprug.org/">IPRUG</a>, <a href="http://www.syncnorwich.com/">SyncNorwich</a> and <a href="http://fesuffolk.co.uk/">FESuffolk</a> allow them to talk code and improve their skills and networking meetings are a chance to meet potential clients in a friendly, less corporate setting. If you have some technical nuance it is worth considering attending a tech meet-up or alternatively, visiting local business meetings may help.</p>
      <p>Like most people and services in the world a great deal can be found on Google. Try to learn what the specific requirements for your project are, spend a significant amount of time searching and you should be able to find someone offering what you need. It is at this point that you need to be mindful of finding out the true skill-set of your developer.</p>
      <p>By far the most convenient and reliable method of finding developers is by word of mouth so try discussing your needs in unconventional situations – although not every guy who works with computers is your ideal contractor, they might know someone who is!</p>

      <h2><a name="contractors">Should I become a Contractor?</a></h2>
      <p>Are you struggling to find work you enjoy in your current role? If so it may be that you want to have more dynamism and variation in your work. This can be achieved through contracting as often, when you change clients you change to a completely new environment. Working on a project for two to three months or even just a week will be the norm, rather than the exception. You also have the freedom to pick and choose which projects you take on (within reason).</p>
      <p>In order to start contracting you need to start from a good place, in a financial sense, which means you need a certain buffer (an amount of savings which you can live upon should times get hard). In time you should be able to increase this buffer and give yourself more security. You need to have a think about current costs of living that include your rent or mortgage, food, bills, potential emergencies (car breaking, pets getting ill, children geting ill or partner losing job) and be confident that you'll be able to overcome these issues should they occur. Saying that, once youve established a good relationship with clients, your buffer can only get stronger and stonger and you can work with confidence, even taking a holiday or two!</p>

      <h2>What are my first steps?</h2>
      <p>Work with a local accountant who you can work with face to face, they should be able to provide you with accurate information in regards to starting up as a sole trader or a limited company.  Building a good relationship with your accountant is important and money is the lifeblood of your business.</p>
      <p>Your accountant will advise you to get professional indemnity insurance, which can be relatively cheap and can protect you in the event of any mishaps. For example, if your computer crashes, you lose a clients' work and they lose business on it they could potentially hold you accountable for the business loss and damage to their reputation which could run into the hundreds of thousands of pounds.</p>
      <p>Although it is very tempting to put all your money into the one pot and assume you can work it our later on (with your accountant) I would advise getting a seperate business bank account, making sure all your payments in go to this account, and all out payments (including wages) all go through it too. This will make things easier when it comes to working out your accounts at the end of the year. All of the major banks provide a business account, but I advise going with one you have a good relathionship and stable history with. Remember, you shouldn't have to pay any fees within the first year of having a business account.</p>
      <p>Are you a sole trader or company? This depends upon your overall goals and business plan. Sole traders tend to work on a smaller scale with a single employee (yourself). They tend to work on an ad hoc basis with many different clients. The financial advantages of being a sole trader are that you pay your accountant less and that your tax is much simpler to calculate. Becoming a limited company is more expensive in terms of employing an accountant and suggests more permanancy in your situation. It provides you with the capacity to take on additional employees and as a limited company and all financial risk is bound to the company rather than yourself, meaning that should you go bankrupt you can dissolve the company and suffer no personal loss.</p>

      <h2>Is starting out expensive?</h2>
      <p>It doesn't need to be. You do, however, need to assess what materials you have available and what equipment you require to start out. If you're working from home on your own computer your expenses are minimal. The majority of your expense will be networking, establishing business links and finding work. It is worth considering early on where your working space is going to be. If you do not have a dedicated room in your home with enough space to work in you should consider desk sharing or renting office space. Often local design agencies and development companies can provide you with desk space in their environment  This has added bonus in having colleagues to bounce ideas off and potential avenues for employment. It also means you won't be stuck at home on your own every day.</p>

      <h2>I'm worried about tax/ employment laws!</h2>
      <!-- <p>IR35</p> -->
      <p>Getting an accountant is perhaps the more important thing you can do on starting out. They will be able to provide you with invaluble advice with reference to tax, accounting, bookeeping and a large amount of employment legislation too.</p>
      <p>Take some time to consider how you would like to invoice your clients and to be able to provide a flexible structure that gives you enough cash flow to survive. Creating an organised system to keep track of invoices is vital, especialy when dealing with  multiple clients. There are many tools available such as xxxx, xxxx or although personally I keep a simple spreadsheet up to date with a simple traffic light colouring system. Green for paid, orange for outstanding, red for overdue.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>How much should I charge?</h2>
      <p>This is perhaps one of the most challenging questions a contractor can ask themselves as there are many factors, both internal and external which should affect your rate. Try to get to know other contractors in a similar field working in your area as rates can vary through the country based on rates of living.</p>
      <p>Depending on the type of contractor you want to be you need to think about the quality of skills you can provide. Be aware that if you charge a high rate and cannot deliver skills to satisfy your clients' needs this will damage your reputation and prevent further work.</p>
      <p>On a more practical note, you need to allow for a variety of expenses in your rate. You need to allow for tax, cost of running your business including travelling to see clients, cost of living, future investments such as employees, potential illness and any holidays or breaks in work (i.e. Christmas or maternity/paternity leave).</p>

      <h2>What&rsquo;s the best way to find clients?</h2>
      <p>There are a wide variety of freelancing sites online such as xxxx, xxxx, and xxxxx. These each have their own distinct advantages and disadvantages as a method of obtaining work. They have their main advantage which is convenience – you can post a profile and see what happens but the major disadvantage is anonymity; No matter how good your profile it's very hard to stand out. It is also very difficult to scope out projects and develop a mature relationship with clients. The scale of work these sites tend to provide is smaller.</p>
      <p>As a developer you're likely to have built up some skills in SEO – lets put those skills to use and build a landing page specifically to describe your work and give yourself a stronger web presence  A large proportion of potential web clients do not know how to find a developer and will simply Google for them.</p>
      <p>Working with clients locally has a great deal of advantages: you're more accessible to each other and are more likely to have things in common. A good way of finding local clients is to attend one of many local meet-ups and networking events. If there are no local meet-ups that are relevant to your skill-set, consider starting your own.</p>
      <p>A lot of the skills you've gained will have been through previous employment. It may well be that your skills are still relevant to a previous employer and they could be a potential source of work or provide you with essential reccommendations for those you'd like to work with in the future.</p>
      <p>Always keep your eyes open and a mind to your business in any social situation; Have a lightening pitch for yourself and your skill-set as you may meet a client on the train, at a party or even on holiday.</p>

      <h2>How can I stay on top of my game?</h2>
      <p>Being up to date on skills is vital to any developer, as soon as you are on your own you need to keep your skills sharp. There are hundreds of websites online with useful articles and resources such as <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a> for a daily update, Reddit's <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming">javascript</a> / <a href='http://www.reddit.com/r/programming'>programming</a> for more of community news. If you hear of a technology, make a note of it and make time to investigate whether it's relevant to your skill-set and worth learning about. Try to learn those skills youre interested in, in great depth as talking about these are a geat way of promoting yourself to new clients and other developers who may be clients themselves. Try to make use of social media such as Twitter and Github. Look at authors of books of programming languages you admire, try to find examples of their code and what they are interested in. Often the very best developers can lead you to projects you've never even heard of.</p>
      <p>Attending local meet-ups and networking environments can give you access to impartial ideas and critique of your processes. This is a vital realtiy check – as a single developer it is easy to get distracted or lost in a specific technology or idea.</p>
