      <h2><a name="employers">What do I look for in a Contractor/ Freelancer?</a></h2>
      <p>One of the main problems that an employer find in recruiting any specialist is in how to find the right person for the job, and being able to know that the are capable of doing that job efficiently.</p>
      <p>Firstly you must consider what resources you have within your own team, do you have any developers who have relevant knowledge? would you be happy to include them in the interview process? Do you have any external trusted resources you can rely upon?</p>
      <p>Taking some time to think about the specific projects you would be taking this developer on for will help you to establish the skill sets you are looking for. For example A single page site based around a single workflow requires very different organisational skills as well as coding skills.</p>
      <p>Try to build a good understanding of the potential developer&rsquo;s past, it should become clear how they work as part of a team and what their areas of interest and expertise in specific areas.</p>

      <h2>How can I recruit effectively?</h2>
      <p>Finding developers is quite a challenge in the current climate, there are a few things to bear in mind when talking to the calibur of developer you want to employ.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Be tentative about using a recruiter, a poorly chosen one can be expensive and can give the wrong impression to developers.</li>
        <li>You aren&rsquo;t the developer&rsquo;s only potential work</li>
        <li>Making your project requirements clear saves both of you time and therefore money</li>
      </ol>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>How do I know they can do what I need?</h2>
      <p>Be clear on what your project involves</p>
      <p>Consult an independent resource on what is the best solution to your problem, base your hiring on this recommendfation. Most developers will believe in the technologies they use and will advocate them passionately. Although most technologies are capable of most standard solutions some have definite advantages.</p>
      <p>Basic people skills will help in establishing how genuine your developer is, They should be able to speak confidently about the problem you are providing and avoid overwhelming them with technical jargon, if you have a technical team member or associate it may be worth having them disucss the project also on a more technical level. it should become clear the competency of the developer.</p>
